# Iolo Spier's GitHub

### Welcome to my GitHub

Currently a Physics with Theoretical Physics student at Imperial College London, I focus on data-driven problem-solving using Python, MATLAB, and statistical analysis. My repository showcases projects involving quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and advanced data science techniques. Here, you'll find examples of my work, including automated trading algorithms, financial models, and research simulations.

### Key Areas of Interest
- **Quantitative Finance**: Developing trading strategies, leveraging machine learning, and conducting market analysis.
- **Data Science**: Building and refining models for predictive analysis, optimisation, and statistical inference.
- **Scientific Computing**: Applying computational methods to model complex systems and solve advanced physics problems.

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out for collaboration opportunities.
